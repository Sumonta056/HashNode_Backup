## 💼 What is a Career?

* A **career** is not a single choice; it’s a **series of decisions** you keep making in life.
    
* For example, you are currently a Software Engineer, which is a result of many decisions you’ve made throughout your life, from choosing your school to selecting your university and beyond.
    

> The goal of life is not to find the perfect job, it’s to build enough skills and experience so you can choose freely. So, Life is all about creating options and options.

## 🔥 What is Passion?

* Passion is a **journey of asking the right questions** and doing things based on your answers.
    
* Passion is not one big talent. It’s the **sum of your small, average talents**
    
* For example, I’m currently working a full-time job, but at some point, I became interested in teaching programming. I asked myself, “Should I give it a try?” I explored that curiosity, found my answer, and started teaching, and now I truly enjoy it. **That’s what passion** is for me at this moment. In the future, my passion might change; it all depends on the questions I ask myself at the right time.
    

> If you’re decent at writing, coding, and explaining, your passion could be **teaching programming**.

## One skill that one should have in Life.

**Critical Thinking**  
“Critical thinking in life is the ability to **analyze information** objectively, **evaluate different perspectives**, and form a **reasoned judgment** to make informed decisions and **solve problems”** - Google

**Observe → Divide → Solve → Repeat**

Critical thinking lets you pause, analyze, and act rather than react.

Life is all about solving problem in different points. So, the better critical thinker the more and the faster you can solve those problems.

## Remember:

1. Everyone is jealous of your **destination**, not your **journey**.
    
2. It’s perfectly fine to be **busy finding yourself**.
    
3. We don’t fear making decisions; we fear **undesirable outcomes**.
    
4. Don’t quit your job to chase passion.
    
    * Stay in your job.
        
    * Hustle on your passion after work.
        
    * If it succeeds → then go all in.

## Do I Even Have a Passion?

Start with **curiosity**; every passion begins there.

Ask yourself:

* What am I curious about?
    
* If everything were possible, what would I do every day?
    
* What do I do because I *want* to, not because I *have to*?
    

💡 **Example List:**

```javascript
- Coding
- Writing or journaling
- Hanging out with friends
- Organizing or arranging stuff
- Traveling
- Taking photos
- Guiding or mentoring others
```

### Discovering Your Passion with Questions

Write down this question and answer honestly. Here I am adding some examples of mine

1. **What activities make you lose track of time?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    - Solving bugs or building features
    - Deep conversations with friends
    - Organizing and setting up systems
    ```
    
2. **What interests or hobbies do you always come back to?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    - Coding or Programming
    - Writing article
    - Mentoring others
    ```
    
3. **What topics do you love learning about?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    - Coding Skills
    - Life lessions and advice from others
    ```
    
4. **What do you enjoy doing even if you’re not the best at it?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    - Coding or Programming
    - Writing article
    - Mentoring others
    ```
    
5. **If money weren’t an issue, how would you spend your days?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    ```
    
6. **What do people usually ask for your help with?**
    
    ```javascript
    (write your own)
    ```
    

I think you should write down all these questions and answer them honestly. Even if you haven’t found your passion yet, you’ll still gain a clearer vision of your life, what’s happening right now and what things you enjoy. For me, that was a game-changer. You should definitely give it a try. Write down the questions, and you’ll start to feel more aware of what’s going on in your life. So go ahead and try it.

## What does success mean to you?

Success is deeply personal. Define it for yourself. What are the definitions of success? Write down this question and answer honestly. Here I am adding some examples.

```javascript
- To be happy in life  
- To do whatever I want, freely  
- To travel wherever I want  
- To not worry about money while creating meaningful work
```

![](https://i.imgflip.com/a9vfnm.jpg align="center")

Deep down, we all believe that money defines success. And yes, in many cases, it does play an important role. But as you move forward in life, you begin to realize that money isn’t the true measure of success. There are many things that matter more than wealth and it’s time to understand that.

## 💔 What If I Fail?

**Can I change industries after 3–4 years?** Absolutely.

> If you had 40 taka and lost 4, would you throw away the remaining 36 to find the lost 4?  
> No. You move forward with what’s left.

## How to Actually Change Your Life?

1. **Write Down What You Want to Change**
    

```javascript
- Sleep cycle  
- Body and fitness  
- Relationships  
- Daily routine and rest  
- Time management
```

2. **Why do you want to change?**
    

```javascript
- For a better and healthier life  
- For a stronger future  
- For smarter time use
```

3. **Where do you want to be?**
    

```javascript
- Life with no pressure or fixed plan  
- Every day feels unique, not repetitive  
- Remote work lifestyle  
- Teaching or consulting online  
- Balanced and calm daily routine
```

Now don’t do the most important thing doing all things together. *Choose one thing to start with and continue doing it for 120 days!*

> *Example: Improve body fitness*

### Decide What You Want to Keep?

Keep the parts of your life that give you energy or identity.

```javascript
- Keep coding  
- Keep learning and writing blogs  
- Keep playing or socializing
```
